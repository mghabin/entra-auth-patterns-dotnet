# .NET 10 / C# 13 — Foundations

Opinionated, cross-cutting defaults for a .NET 10 codebase. Everything here is
do-this-by-default; deviations should be justified in code review. ASP.NET Core,
EF Core, testing, perf, cloud-native, and client topics are covered in sibling
documents.

> Conventions: **Do** = required default. **Don't** = reject in review unless a
> written exception exists. **Prefer** = strong default; use the alternative
> only with measurement or a documented constraint.

## 1. Solution & projects

**Pin the SDK.** Every repo has a `global.json` at root with an explicit SDK
version and `rollForward: latestFeature`. This stops "works on my machine" from
SDK drift and makes CI reproducible.

```json
{ "sdk": { "version": "10.0.100", "rollForward": "latestFeature", "allowPrerelease": false } }
```

**Use `.slnx`.** The XML solution format (GA in VS 17.14 / .NET SDK 9.0.200+) is
the future of solution files; it is human-readable, diff-friendly, and
officially supported by `dotnet sln`, MSBuild, and Rider/VS. New repos should
not start with `.sln`. Migrate existing ones with `dotnet sln migrate`.

**Centralize MSBuild defaults in `Directory.Build.props`** at repo root:

```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>
    <LangVersion>latest</LangVersion>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>
    <WarningsNotAsErrors></WarningsNotAsErrors> <!-- add specific IDs only with justification -->
    <EnforceCodeStyleInBuild>true</EnforceCodeStyleInBuild>
    <AnalysisLevel>latest-recommended</AnalysisLevel>
    <AnalysisMode>All</AnalysisMode>
    <EnableNETAnalyzers>true</EnableNETAnalyzers>
    <GenerateDocumentationFile>true</GenerateDocumentationFile>
    <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);CS1591</NoWarn> <!-- silence "missing XML doc" project-wide; opt back in per-lib -->
    <Deterministic>true</Deterministic>
    <ContinuousIntegrationBuild Condition="'$(CI)' == 'true'">true</ContinuousIntegrationBuild>
    <PublishRepositoryUrl>true</PublishRepositoryUrl>
    <EmbedUntrackedSources>true</EmbedUntrackedSources>
    <IncludeSymbols>true</IncludeSymbols>
    <SymbolPackageFormat>snupkg</SymbolPackageFormat>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.SourceLink.GitHub" PrivateAssets="All" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

**Central Package Management.** Add `Directory.Packages.props` and set
`<ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>true</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>`. Csproj
files reference packages without versions; the props file is the single source
of truth. Combine with `<CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>true</...>` to
also pin transitives.

**`.editorconfig`** is mandatory and authoritative. Drive both IDE and
`dotnet format` from it. Don't duplicate analyzer severity in `.ruleset` files
— set `dotnet_diagnostic.<ID>.severity` in `.editorconfig`.

**Project layout.** One assembly per bounded responsibility; keep `src/` and
`tests/` siblings. Avoid the `Common`/`Utilities` dumping ground — it becomes a
cycle magnet. Internal types + `InternalsVisibleTo` for test seams; no
`public` for things consumers shouldn't depend on.

**Deterministic & reproducible builds.** `Deterministic=true` + Source Link +
`ContinuousIntegrationBuild=true` on CI gives byte-stable outputs and PDBs that
debuggers can resolve to GitHub source. Do not skip Source Link on internal
libs; you will want it the first time prod stack-traces hit a NuGet'd package.

---

## 2. Language (C# 13)

**File-scoped namespaces, always.** One namespace per file, declared with
`namespace Foo.Bar;`. Saves an indent level and is enforced via
`csharp_style_namespace_declarations = file_scoped:error`.

**`global using` directives** belong in a single `GlobalUsings.cs` per project,
not scattered. Don't `global using` your own domain types — only framework
namespaces (`System.Collections.Immutable`, `System.Threading.Channels`).

**Primary constructors — use them sparingly.** They are *not* records.
Captured parameters become hidden mutable fields with no readonly guarantee,
they can shadow base members, and the captured parameter is in scope for the
entire class body which encourages accidental allocation per-method. Use them
for small DI-style holders where every member just forwards a dependency:

```csharp
public sealed class OrderService(IOrderRepository repo, ILogger<OrderService> logger)
{
    public Task<Order?> GetAsync(OrderId id, CancellationToken ct) => repo.GetAsync(id, ct);
}
```

**Don't** mix primary-ctor parameters with additional fields/state, and **don't**
use them on `struct`s where you actually want `readonly` semantics. Promote to
explicit `private readonly` fields the moment a class grows non-trivial state.

**`required` members > constructor explosion.** For DTOs and config types,
prefer `required init` properties over telescoping constructors. Combine with
`SetsRequiredMembersAttribute` only when the type genuinely has a "build it
all in one shot" constructor.

**Records vs classes.**
- `record` (class): immutable data with value equality. DTOs, value objects,
  events, messages.
- `record struct` (readonly): tiny immutable value types (≤16 bytes-ish, no
  heap references) — IDs, coordinates, money.
- `class`: identity, behavior, mutability, or anything held by a DI container.
- `struct`: only with measurement; default to readonly.

Don't use records for entities with identity (EF entities) — equality semantics
will bite you.

**Init-only vs readonly.** `init` for properties on immutable types
(serializable, with-expression friendly). `readonly` for fields inside
mutable classes that must not change after construction.

**Collection expressions** (`[]`, `[..xs, y]`) are the default. They pick the
optimal target type (`List<T>`, `T[]`, `ImmutableArray<T>`, `Span<T>`, etc.) and
beat hand-rolled `new List<T> { ... }` for many cases. Combine with
`params ReadOnlySpan<T>` (C# 13) on hot APIs to avoid array allocation.

**`params` collections (C# 13).** Library APIs taking `params` should use
`params ReadOnlySpan<T>` when the values are consumed eagerly — callers using
collection expressions get zero-alloc dispatch.

**`ref readonly` vs `in`.** `in` is "I won't mutate it, copy is fine if I
need"; `ref readonly` is "I want a non-defensive-copy alias and I promise I
won't mutate." Use `ref readonly` parameters for large readonly structs you
pass through hot loops; `in` is fine for general "no copy please" intent. For
fields of large structs, declare `ref readonly` returns rather than copying.

**Pattern matching style.** Prefer switch expressions over if/else chains for
total mappings; use property and list patterns where they read naturally;
do not chain more than ~5 arms — extract to a method. `is { } x` for
"non-null and capture"; avoid `is not null` *plus* `!` later in the same scope
(the flow analysis already gives you non-null).

**`using` declarations** (no braces) are the default — fewer indents, same
deterministic disposal. Only use the block form when scope must end before the
method does.

---

## 3. Nullable reference types

NRT is non-negotiable. Every project sets `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` at
the `Directory.Build.props` level. New code that introduces nullable warnings
fails the build (`TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`).

**The `!` operator is a code smell, not a tool.** It is acceptable in exactly
three places: (a) test code asserting a value the test just produced,
(b) immediately after a framework method whose nullability is wrong (and you
file the bug), (c) inside a generic helper where you've proven non-null but
the analyzer can't see it. Anywhere else, fix the contract.

**Use the flow attributes.** They are the public-API contract:

- `[NotNullWhen(true)] out T? value` — `Try*` patterns.
- `[MaybeNullWhen(false)] out T value` — same, inverted.
- `[NotNull] ref T? value` — "I will assign non-null."
- `[MemberNotNull(nameof(_field))]` on init helpers called from constructors.
- `[MemberNotNullWhen(true, nameof(_x))]` on `IsInitialized`-style flags.
- `[DoesNotReturn]` / `[DoesNotReturnIf(false)]` on guard helpers — flow
  analysis treats subsequent reads as non-null.

**Public API contracts.** Library `public`/`protected` surface must have
deliberate nullability. `string?` parameters mean "null is meaningful";
`string` means "I will throw on null." Throw with
`ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(arg)` — it is annotated and feeds the
analyzer.

**Generics.** `T?` on an unconstrained generic means
`default(T)` — which is `null` for reference types and `0`/`default` for value
types, *not* `Nullable<T>`. If you need `Nullable<T>` semantics, constrain
with `where T : struct` and write `T?` explicitly, or use two overloads.
`where T : notnull` is the right constraint for "no nulls through here".

**Don't suppress at the project level.** `#nullable disable` is for
auto-generated files only. New code does not get a nullable annotation
amnesty.

---

## 4. Async

The canon (Stephen Cleary): **async all the way, no sync-over-async, configure
await in libraries, cancellation everywhere**.

**Never sync-over-async.** `.Result`, `.Wait()`, `GetAwaiter().GetResult()` on
a `Task` you produced are deadlock and threadpool-starvation grenades. The
only legitimate use is at a true sync entry point you don't own (e.g.
`Main` in some hosts — and even then, prefer `await` with `async Main`).

**`ConfigureAwait(false)` in libraries**, never in app/UI/ASP.NET Core
endpoint code. ASP.NET Core has no sync context, so it's a no-op there, but
shared libraries don't know who calls them. Enforce with `CA2007`.

**`ValueTask<T>` only when measured.** Default to `Task<T>`. `ValueTask` exists
to avoid allocations on hot paths that are *usually synchronous* (cache hits,
buffered reads). Misusing it (awaiting twice, blocking on it, storing it) is a
correctness bug. Rule of thumb: if you can't point to a benchmark, use `Task`.

**`IAsyncEnumerable<T>`** for streamed pull-based pipelines (paged APIs, log
tails, EF Core `AsAsyncEnumerable`). Always accept and propagate
`[EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken`:

```csharp
public async IAsyncEnumerable<Page> ReadAsync(
    [EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken ct = default) { ... }
```

For push-based fan-in/out, use `System.Threading.Channels` — bounded
`Channel<T>` is the right primitive for producer/consumer. Don't reach for
Rx/`IObservable<T>` unless you actually need temporal operators.

**Cancellation propagation is mandatory.** Every async method that does I/O
takes `CancellationToken ct` as the *last* parameter and forwards it.
Background services use `stoppingToken`; HTTP endpoints use
`HttpContext.RequestAborted` (already wired into minimal API parameter
binding). `Task.Delay` without `ct` is a bug.

**Parallel composition.**
- `Task.WhenAll` — fan-out a known small set of independent awaitables.
  Materialize with `await Task.WhenAll(tasks)`, then read `.Result` on each
  (safe, all completed). Aggregate exceptions: read every task or wrap in
  `try`/`catch` knowing only the first throws.
- `Parallel.ForEachAsync` — bounded async iteration over a collection with
  `MaxDegreeOfParallelism`. This is the right tool for "process N things, no
  more than K at a time, with cancellation."
- Avoid `Task.WhenAll(Enumerable.Select(...))` for unbounded collections —
  you'll DoS your dependencies.

**`await using`** for `IAsyncDisposable` (HTTP responses, DB connections,
streams in .NET). Don't mix `using`/`await using` on the same async-disposable
— the sync `Dispose` may block.

**Don't `async void`.** Except for event handlers. Exceptions go to
`SynchronizationContext` / `TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException` and crash
the process.

**Don't capture `this` accidentally** in long-lived `async` lambdas held by a
singleton — the captured state is the lifetime of the singleton.

---

## 5. DI & lifetimes

**Three lifetimes, one rule: never inject a shorter-lived service into a
longer-lived one.** That is the *captive dependency* trap. Singletons that
take an `IScoped` capture the first scope's instance for the process lifetime.
Set `ServiceProviderOptions.ValidateScopes = true` and `ValidateOnBuild = true`
in development; the host does this by default in Development environment, but
turn it on explicitly so it can't regress.

**Background work needs `IServiceScopeFactory`.** Inject the factory into your
`BackgroundService`/`IHostedService`, then `await using var scope =
_scopeFactory.CreateAsyncScope();` per unit of work. Resolving a scoped
`DbContext` directly into a hosted service is the canonical bug.

**Keyed services (.NET 8+).** Use them when you have multiple
implementations of the same abstraction selected by a stable key
(`AddKeyedSingleton<IHasher, Sha256Hasher>("sha256")`). Don't simulate this
with factories anymore. Don't use keyed services as a string-typed plugin
registry — that's a configuration smell.

**Options pattern surfaces.**
- `IOptions<T>` — singleton snapshot, value resolved once. Use for
  config that never changes after startup.
- `IOptionsSnapshot<T>` — scoped, re-bound per request. Use in request-scoped
  services that need reload-on-change semantics. **Cannot** be injected into
  singletons.
- `IOptionsMonitor<T>` — singleton, push-notified on change with
  `OnChange`. Use in singletons that must react to config reload.

If you find yourself injecting `IOptions<T>` into a class that already takes
the typed value — just inject `T` (registered with
`services.AddSingleton(sp => sp.GetRequiredService<IOptions<T>>().Value)`).

**`IHttpClientFactory` for every outbound HTTP call.** Never `new
HttpClient()` (socket exhaustion) and never hold a static `HttpClient` for a
host that may rotate DNS. Two flavors:

- **Named clients**: `services.AddHttpClient("github", c => ...)`, resolved
  via `IHttpClientFactory.CreateClient("github")`. Good for a small number of
  ad-hoc calls.
- **Typed clients**: `services.AddHttpClient<IGitHubClient, GitHubClient>(...)`.
  The class takes `HttpClient` in its constructor; lifetime is **transient**,
  but the underlying handler is pooled. This is the default — it gives you a
  testable seam and DI-resolved configuration.

Add resilience via `Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience` (Polly v8 under the
hood): `.AddStandardResilienceHandler()` gets you retry+circuit-breaker+timeout
defaults that are sensible.

---

## 6. Configuration & options pattern

**Bind sections to typed records, validate at startup, fail fast.**

```csharp
services.AddOptions<GitHubOptions>()
        .BindConfiguration("GitHub")
        .ValidateDataAnnotations()
        .ValidateOnStart();
```

`ValidateOnStart()` runs validators in the host's `StartAsync` and aborts the
process on failure — far better than discovering the misconfiguration on the
first request that touches it.

**Beyond DataAnnotations**, implement `IValidateOptions<T>` for cross-field
rules, or use the `[OptionsValidator]` source generator (.NET 8+) which
generates a zero-reflection validator at compile time:

```csharp
[OptionsValidator]
public partial class GitHubOptionsValidator : IValidateOptions<GitHubOptions> { }
```

**Layering.** Default order: `appsettings.json` →
`appsettings.{Environment}.json` → user-secrets (Development only) →
environment variables → command-line. Don't fight the precedence; document it.

**Secret hygiene.**
- Never put secrets in `appsettings*.json` (even Development).
- Don't set secrets in shell env vars on dev machines — they leak into every
  process and shell history. Use `dotnet user-secrets` for local dev.
- In every other environment, use Key Vault (or your cloud equivalent) and
  reference via the configuration provider; the provider handles rotation.
- `ILogger` redaction: ensure secrets are never tokens in structured log
  templates; wrap in a custom type that overrides `ToString()`.

**Don't read `IConfiguration` directly** in service code. Bind to options at
composition root; injecting `IConfiguration` into business logic is a code
smell that defeats validation, defeats reload, and defeats testability.

---

## 7. Disposal

**`IDisposable` for unmanaged or scoped resources; `IAsyncDisposable` when
disposal does I/O.** A type that owns a `Stream`, `HttpResponseMessage`, DB
connection, or `CancellationTokenSource` must dispose it.

**`using` declarations** (`using var x = ...;`) are the default — they dispose
at end of scope without an extra indent.

**The full dispose pattern** (`protected virtual Dispose(bool)` + finalizer)
is for types that *directly* hold unmanaged resources. **Don't write
finalizers** otherwise — they make types more expensive (finalization queue),
delay GC, and almost always indicate the wrong design. If your type only owns
managed `IDisposable`s, implement `IDisposable` simply and forward; no
finalizer, no `GC.SuppressFinalize`.

For async-disposable resources, implement both interfaces if the type can be
used in sync contexts; otherwise just `IAsyncDisposable`. Don't call
`Dispose()` from `DisposeAsync()` if it would block.

**`CancellationTokenSource` is `IDisposable`.** Linked CTS instances
(`CreateLinkedTokenSource`) leak callback registrations until disposed —
always `using`.

---

## 8. Exceptions

**Exceptions for exceptional.** Validation failures from user input are not
exceptional — return them as values (model-state errors, `ProblemDetails`,
`Result<T>`). Authorization failures, missing-but-expected resources,
optimistic concurrency, downstream timeouts — all *expected* on a healthy
system; design them as flow, not throws.

**Don't catch `Exception`.** Two exceptions: (1) a top-level boundary that
logs and converts to a transport error (ASP.NET exception handler middleware,
hosted service supervisor), (2) an explicit "best effort" with documented
rationale. Catch the narrowest type that captures intent.

**Don't swallow.** `catch { }` is a bug. `catch (Exception ex) { _logger.LogError(ex, "..."); }`
without a re-throw is also a bug unless this *is* the boundary.

**`Result<T>` / `OneOf<T1,T2>` — when warranted.** A `Result` discriminated
union is appropriate when the failure is part of the domain contract and
callers must handle each variant (e.g., `Created | DuplicateEmail | Invalid`).
Don't blanket-replace exceptions with `Result` — you lose stack traces, you
add ceremony to every call site, and you re-invent checked exceptions. Pick
per-API.

**`ExceptionDispatchInfo` for re-throw across async boundaries.** When you
captured an exception (e.g., from a fan-out) and want to rethrow it elsewhere
without losing the original stack:

```csharp
ExceptionDispatchInfo.Capture(ex).Throw();
```

A bare `throw ex;` resets the stack — never do that. `throw;` (no operand) in
a catch block preserves it.

**Custom exception types** should be sparse and meaningful. If callers won't
catch it specifically, it shouldn't exist as its own type — a built-in
(`InvalidOperationException`, `ArgumentException`) is fine.

---

## 9. Immutability & DTO design

**Default to immutable.** `record` (or `record struct`) with `init`-only
members, then mutate via `with`-expressions. The compiler-generated
equality and `ToString()` are bonuses; the real win is reasoning about
state.

```csharp
public sealed record Order(OrderId Id, CustomerId Customer, ImmutableArray<LineItem> Lines)
{
    public Order AddLine(LineItem line) => this with { Lines = Lines.Add(line) };
}
```

**Use `ImmutableArray<T>`/`ImmutableList<T>`** in DTO surfaces; don't expose
`List<T>` you didn't mean to allow callers to mutate. `IReadOnlyList<T>` is a
view, not a guarantee — a hostile caller can downcast.

**When mutability is right.** Long-lived stateful services (caches, queues,
aggregates inside an aggregate root), perf-critical builders, anything where
the cost of allocation per change dominates. Be explicit: name the type
`MutableX` or document why.

**Equality.** Records get value equality by default. For value objects (money,
ids) that's exactly right. For entities with identity, override or write a
class — never let two `Customer` records with the same fields be `==`.

---

## 10. Source generators

Source generators have replaced reflection for the cases below. Use them by
default; fall back to reflection only when shape isn't statically knowable.

- **`LoggerMessage` source generator** (`[LoggerMessage(...)]`) for all hot-path
  logging. It eliminates boxing, string formatting, and the enabled-check
  ceremony. Unstructured `_logger.LogInformation($"...")` is a bug — it
  defeats structured logging and allocates even when disabled.
- **`System.Text.Json` source generator** (`[JsonSerializable(typeof(T))]` on a
  partial `JsonSerializerContext`). Required for AOT/trimming, faster than
  reflection-based serialization, and removes a runtime startup cost. Pass
  the context to `JsonSerializer.Serialize(value, MyContext.Default.MyType)`.
- **`GeneratedRegex`** (`[GeneratedRegex(@"...")]` on a `partial` method).
  Compiles at build time, no `RegexOptions.Compiled` warmup, AOT-safe.
- **`OptionsValidator`** (`[OptionsValidator]`, see §6). Replaces
  reflection-based validation.
- **Minimal API `RequestDelegate` generator** (on by default in ASP.NET Core
  7+). Removes per-request reflection; you get it for free as long as your
  endpoint signatures are static. Don't dynamically build endpoints if you
  can express them statically.
- **`StringSyntax` + interceptors** for compile-time SQL/JSON validation in
  selected libraries — adopt as the ecosystem stabilizes.

If you write your own generator, ship it as a separate analyzer project with
`<IsRoslynComponent>true</IsRoslynComponent>`, target
`netstandard2.0`, and **never** take third-party dependencies (the analyzer
runs in the IDE — every dep becomes a load-order hazard).

---

## 11. Build hygiene

**`dotnet format`** runs in CI on every PR (`--verify-no-changes`) and as a
pre-commit hook. Fights happen once, in `.editorconfig`, never in review.

**Analyzers — the baseline set:**
- **`Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers`** (built into the SDK) at
  `AnalysisMode=All`, `AnalysisLevel=latest-recommended`. This is the floor.
- **`Roslynator.Analyzers`** for code-style and refactoring suggestions
  beyond what the SDK ships.
- **`SonarAnalyzer.CSharp`** for bug-pattern and cognitive-complexity rules
  (the free Roslyn package, no SonarQube server needed).
- **`Meziantou.Analyzer`** — opinionated rules that catch real
  bugs (sync-over-async, `DateTime.Now` misuse, culture-sensitive string ops,
  task-related foot-guns). Treat as required.
- **`AsyncFixer`** if your team still ships sync-over-async by accident.

Wire them via `Directory.Packages.props` so versions are unified, and via
`Directory.Build.props` so every project gets them automatically.

**Pre-commit with Husky.NET.** `dotnet husky install` then a task runner
(`task-runner.json`) that runs `dotnet format`, `dotnet build --no-restore
-warnaserror`, and any project-specific lints. Keep it under ~10s — a slow
hook gets bypassed.

**NuGet hygiene.**
- `dotnet restore --locked-mode` in CI; commit `packages.lock.json` with
  `<RestorePackagesWithLockFile>true</RestorePackagesWithLockFile>`. Locked
  restore is your supply-chain trip-wire.
- `dotnet list package --vulnerable --include-transitive` in CI. Fail the
  build on a known CVE.
- `<NuGetAudit>true</NuGetAudit>` (default in modern SDKs) and
  `<NuGetAuditMode>all</NuGetAuditMode>` to include transitives.
  `NuGetAuditLevel=moderate` is a reasonable bar.
- Single feed in `nuget.config` with `<clear />` first, then your sources.
  Never let a second feed sneak a package in.

**Deterministic + reproducible builds.** Beyond `Deterministic=true`,
`ContinuousIntegrationBuild=true` strips local paths from PDBs so two
machines produce byte-identical artifacts. Combined with Source Link, you can
debug a NuGet'd library straight to the commit it was built from.

**Don't ship `Debug` binaries.** CI publishes `Release` with
`-p:DebugType=portable` and pushes `.snupkg` symbols separately to your symbol
server (or NuGet.org's).
